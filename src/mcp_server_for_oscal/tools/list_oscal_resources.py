    Retrieve a comprehensive directory of OSCAL community resources and tools.

    This tool provides access to a curated collection of OSCAL (Open Security Controls Assessment Language)
    community resources that can help users:

    - Find OSCAL-compatible tools and software implementations
    - Discover educational content, tutorials, and documentation
    - Access example OSCAL documents and templates
    - Locate presentations, articles, and research papers about OSCAL
    - Identify government and industry adoption examples
    - Find libraries and SDKs for OSCAL development
    - Access validation tools and utilities

    The returned content is structured markdown that categorizes resources by type (tools, content,
    presentations, etc.) making it easy to find specific types of OSCAL resources based on user needs.

    Use this tool when users ask about:
    - "What OSCAL tools are available?"
    - "How can I learn more about OSCAL?"
    - "Are there examples of OSCAL implementations?"
    - "What resources exist for OSCAL development?"
    - "Who is using OSCAL in production?"

    Args:
        ctx: MCP server context (should be injected automatically by MCP server)

    Returns:
        str: Complete markdown content containing categorized OSCAL community resources,
             tools, documentation, examples, and educational materials

    Raises:
        FileNotFoundError: If the awesome-oscal.md content cannot be found
